1 . Key Features of HTML 5 :
a. Improved support for embedding graphics , audio and video via the <canvas> , <audio>  and <video> tags .
b. Enhancements of api's like geolocation , drag and drop 
c . Introduction of web workers .
d . New semantic elments which were added to enhance the meaning of the HTML page elements like <article>,
    <section>,<footer>,<nav>,<header>,<aside> tags to name a few .
e . New form elements such as <date>, <time>,<email>,<

2 . Semantic HTML Elements :

3 . Web workers : Web workers at last bring about the concept of multip - threading in javascript .
                  A web worker is a thread / process running in the background without affecting impacting the 
                  current process which is being run.
                  A web worker is a script that runs in the background (i.e., in another thread)
                  without the page needing to wait for it to complete. 
                  The user can interact with the page which the web worker is running in the background .


4 . How do you indicate the character set being used by an HTML5 document? 
    How does this differ from older HTML standards?
    :In HTML5 document the charset is being indicated by the charset element inside the head tag.
    <meta charset ="UTF-8">

5 . Describe the usage of header , footer , article and section tags of HTML .
6 . Can a <section> contain <article> elements? Can an <article> contain <section> elements? Provide usage examples.
    : YES both can contain each other .
    
7 . Can a web page contain multiple <header> elements? What about <footer> elements?
    :Yes to both. In fact, both the <header> and <footer> tags are designed to serve their respective purposes
    in relation to whatever their parent “section” may be. So not only can the page <body> contain a header and a footer,
    but so can every <article> and <section> element. In fact, a <header> should be present for all of these, 
    although a <footer> is not always necessary.

8 . Describe the relationship between the <header> and <h1> tags in HTML5.
    :In previous specifications of HTML, only one <h1> element was typically present on a page, 
    used for the heading of the entire page. HTML5 specifies that <h1> represents the top-level heading of a “section”,
    whether that be the page <body>, or an <article> or <section> element. 
    In fact, every <header> element should at least contain an <h1> element. 
   If there is no natural heading for the section, it is a good indication it should not use an <article> or <section> tag.

9 . Give a simple implementation of the <video> tag to embed a video 
    stored at http://www.example.com/amazing_video.mp4. Give the video a width of 640 pixels by 360 pixels.
    Provide the user with controls.
   : <video src="http://www.example.com/amazing_video.mp4" width ="640" height="360" controls></video>

10 . What is HTML5 Web Storage? Explain localStorage and sessionStorage.
   : With HTML5, web pages can store data locally within the user’s browser.

    Earlier, this was done with cookies. However, Web Storage is more secure and faster.
     The data is not included with every server request, but used ONLY when asked for.

     The data is stored in name/value pairs, and a web page can only access data stored by itself.
     Unlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server.
     
     Local storage : Data stored through localStorage is permanent: it does not expire and remains stored on the user’s 
     computer until a web app deletes it or the user asks the browser to delete it. 
     SessionStorage : has the same lifetime as the top-level window or browser tab in which the script that stored 
     it is running. When the window or tab is permanently closed, any data stored through sessionStorage is deleted.

     Both forms of storage are scoped to the document origin so that documents with different origins will never
     share the stored objects .
     If a user has two browser tabs displaying documents from the same origin, those two tabs have separate 
     sessionStorage data .
